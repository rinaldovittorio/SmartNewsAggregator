# SmartNewsAggregator
This is my university project.


Hello and welcome to my project


This app is called smart news aggregator and work only with Xcode 10+ 

I did not include the pod folder as you can install all the framework from the pod file included.

It is under creative commons as the code is similar for everyone and everybody,
so I decided to make it free to use, but please use it for the indeded use and not for illegal purposes as at the end of the days we are developers and we should have some ethic. 

Most of the code lerned and applied in this application has been learned from tutorials online, so that is another reason as it is under creative commons.
